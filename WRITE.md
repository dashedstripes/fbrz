- setRange works differently based on Node type
- building an abstraction on top of DOM instead of using it directly saves me headaches
- update values directly instead of re-rendering entire tree
- define the API first, then worry about implementation
- fixing when selection is made from bottom up (flip anchors using index)
- understand the problem first
